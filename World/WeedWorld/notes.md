# To do tomorrow. 
write a getNeighbor fun to get a list of address so that we can spawn near them. (should take in a radius) 
would reuturn a vector of locations. 
Need to deal with toroidal stuff. 

with the get geNeighbor() fn we can check to see how many neighbors there are so that we can feed the plants accoridinly. 

feed the plants every update (depending on neighbors) 

If the plants have enough food, they can spawn randomly on one of their neighbors. 

clean up :)
